# rdew

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `rdew` is to provide data and simple functions related
to the video game Stardew Valley.

In its final form, this package should contain tabular versions of all
of the datasets contained in the Stardew Valley game data. In its
current form, this package contains data for:

  - Big Craftables
  - Crops
  - Furniture
  - Hats
  - Weapons

This package is in its early form, and so should be used with caution.
Data and methods may change frequently until it reaches a more stable
form.

Comments and contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or make a
pull request. ðŸ˜„
