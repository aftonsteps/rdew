\title{Crops Data}
\format{
A data frame with 42 rows and 22 variables:
\describe{
  \item{seed_object_id}{unique id of the object, but note that this joins to the
  seed's id, not the full-grown crop's id in other datasets. If you want to
  join this crops table to the information about the resulting crop (e.g. fruit
  or vegatable resulting from growing) then join on `crops$object_id` =
  `objects$crop_object_id`.}
  \item{seed_name}{the name of the seed}
  \item{days_in_stage_1_growth}{days in first stage of growth}
  \item{days_in_stage_2_growth}{days in second stage of growth}
  \item{days_in_stage_3_growth}{days in third stage of growth, and if NA then
  growth is completed prior to this stage}
  \item{days_in_stage_4_growth}{days in fourth stage of growth, and if NA then
  growth is completed prior to this stage}
  \item{days_in_stage_5_growth}{days in fifth stage of growth, and if NA then
  growth is completed prior to this stage}
  \item{growth_season_spring}{boolean representing if the crop grows in
  spring}
  \item{growth_season_summer}{boolean representing if the crop grows in
  summer}
  \item{growth_season_fall}{boolean representing if the crop grows in
  fall}
  \item{growth_season_winter}{boolean representing if the crop grows in
  winter}
  \item{index_in_sprite_sheet}{index of the sprite associated with this crop}
  \item{index_of_harvest}{objectid of the fully-grown crop, in constrast with
  `objectid` which is the unique id of the seed}
  \item{regrow_after_harvest}{-1 if the crop only grows once, and otherwise
  the number of days required to produce a new crop yield}
  \item{harvest_method}{1 if the item must be harvested with a scythe, else
  0}
  \item{chance_for_extra_harvest}{boolean representing if this plant allows
  probabilistic extra crop(s) at harvest}
  \item{min_extra_harvest}{the minimum number of extra crops produced, if an
  "extra harvest" event occurs}
  \item{max_extra_harvest}{the maximum number of extra crops produced, if an
  "extra harvest" event occurs}
  \item{max_harvest_increase_per_farming_level}{the maximum increase in crops
  per farming level, which adds to `max_extra_harvest`}
  \item{chance_for_extra_crops}{the probability of getting an extra harvest}
  \item{raised_seeds}{boolean representing if this crop grows on a raised
  item such as a pole subsequently and block your character from walking
  through this square}
  \item{tint_color}{boolean representing if ths item has special tints, e.g.
  certain flowers have various possible colors}
  \item{tint_color_value}{if `tint_color` is true, then sets of rgb values for
  each of the possible tints}
  \item{crop_name}{the name of the resulting crop, after the seed has grown}
  \item{crop_object_id}{the object id of the crop, which can be joined to `objects`
  for further information}
  \item{is_probabalistic}{TRUE if the crop is one of a set of randomly selected
  possible crop for the seed (e.g. for spring seeds, summer seeds, etc.)}

\description{
A dataset containing information about seeds, crops, crop growing
Stardew Valley. Much of this information concerns the growing of crops from
seeds. If you want further information about the crop (e.g. fruits and vegetables)
that result from growing, you may want to join this table to `object_information`
on `index_of_harvest` = `object_id`
